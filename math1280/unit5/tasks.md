Scenario:

A local bakery, known for its artisan bread, monitors operational data to improve its business strategies. On weekdays, the bakery receives an average of 4 online bread orders per hour. Some customers repeatedly attempt to order limited-edition bread until they succeed. The bakery also conducts special promotions, randomly selecting a certain number of customers to win free bread vouchers. Your task is to study this data using probability distributions to help the bakery in its operations.

Question:

Find the probability that the bakery will receive exactly 6 orders in a single hour on a weekday, with clear indications of all notations, formulas, and calculation steps. Also, discuss the key features of the Poisson distribution that make it suitable for this situation.


Answer:
To find the probability that the bakery will receive exactly 6 orders in a single hour on a weekday, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is suitable for modeling the number of events (in this case, bread orders) that occur in a fixed interval of time or space when these events happen with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

The formula for the Poisson probability mass function is given by:

P(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!

Where:
- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events in the interval
- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events (mean)
- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828)
- k! is the factorial of k

In this scenario:
- λ = 4 (the average number of orders per hour)
- k = 6 (the number of orders we want to find the probability for)

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

P(X = 6) = (4^6 * e^(-4)) / 6!

Calculating each component:
- 4^6 = 4096
- e^(-4) ≈ 0.0183156
- 6! = 720

Now we can calculate P(X = 6):

P(X = 6) = (4096 * 0.0183156) / 720
          ≈ 0.1024

Therefore, the probability that the bakery will receive exactly 6 orders in a single hour on a weekday is approximately 0.1024, or 10.24%.

Key features of the Poisson distribution that make it suitable for this situation include:
1. Discreteness: The Poisson distribution models discrete events (e.g., number of orders) in a fixed interval.
2. Independence: The occurrence of one event (order) does not affect the occurrence of another.
3. Constant mean rate: The average rate of orders (λ) is known and remains constant over time.

These features align well with the bakery's operational data, making the Poisson distribution an appropriate choice for analysis.

Assignment Information:
Imagine a medium-sized urban hospital emergency room aiming to enhance its understanding of patient flow and testing procedures. The hospital administration is leveraging probability distributions to model different aspects of its operations, such as patient arrivals, diagnostic test completions, and treatment durations. A data-driven approach can help streamline processes, reduce waiting times, and optimize resource allocation. 

Your task is to analyze the hospital's operations and use geometric and hypergeometric distributions to gain valuable insights into its functioning. 

1. Geometric Distribution
The hospital is testing the effectiveness of its triage process. If the probability of successfully triaging a patient on the first attempt is 0.7, what is the probability that the third triage attempt will be the first successful one? Please clearly indicate all notations, formulas, and calculation steps in your answer. 

2. Hypergeometric Distribution
Out of 20 recently arrived patients, 5 have flu. A team randomly selects samples from 4 patients for testing. What is the probability that exactly 2 of these 4 selected samples have flu? Please clearly indicate all notations, formulas, and calculation steps in your answer. 


Answer:
1. **Geometric Distribution**
To find the probability that the third triage attempt will be the first successful one, we can use the geometric distribution formula:

P(X = k) = (1 - p)^(k - 1) * p

Where:
- P(X = k) is the probability that the k-th trial is the first success
- p is the probability of success on each trial
- (1 - p) is the probability of failure on each trial
- k is the number of trials until the first success
- k = 3 (the third attempt)
- p = 0.7 (the probability of successfully triaging a patient on the first attempt)
- (1 - p) = 0.3 (the probability of failure on each attempt)
- k = 3 (the third attempt)

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

P(X = 3) = (0.3)^(3 - 1) * (0.7)
          = (0.3)^2 * (0.7)
          = 0.09 * 0.7
          = 0.063

Therefore, the probability that the third triage attempt will be the first successful one is approximately 0.063, or 6.3%.

2. **Hypergeometric Distribution**
To find the probability that exactly 2 out of 4 selected patients have flu, we can use the hypergeometric distribution formula:

P(X = k) = (C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)) / C(N, n)

Where:
- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes in the sample
- C(a, b) is the binomial coefficient "a choose b"
- K is the total number of successes in the population
- N is the total population size
- n is the sample size
- k is the number of successes in the sample
- K = 5 (the number of patients with flu)
- N = 20 (the total number of patients)
- n = 4 (the number of patients selected for testing)
- k = 2 (the number of patients with flu in the selected sample)

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

P(X = 2) = (C(5, 2) * C(15, 2)) / C(20, 4)

Calculating each component:
C(5, 2) = 10
C(15, 2) = 105
C(20, 4) = 4845

Now we can calculate P(X = 2):

P(X = 2) = (10 * 105) / 4845
          ≈ 0.216

Therefore, the probability that exactly 2 of the 4 selected samples have flu is approximately 0.216, or 21.6%.
