Scenario:
Imagine you visit the same coffee shop every morning for a month and record the time it takes to receive your coffee after placing your order. After analyzing the data, you notice that the wait times follow a normal distribution. Most days, the wait time is close to an average of 8 minutes, with a standard deviation of 2 minutes. Some days, the wait is unusually short due to low customer traffic, while on others, it’s significantly longer because of a rush or staffing issues. This information helps you estimate how long you’ll usually wait and prepare for rare occasions of extreme delays. 

Questions: 

1. Explain the key properties and their practical benefit from the normal distribution in relation to the given example. 
2. Using the given mean (8 minutes) and standard deviation (2 minutes), show the calculation for the Z-score and find the probability of a wait time exceeding 10 minutes on a given day.

Answer:
1. The key properties of the normal distribution include its symmetry around the mean, the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule), and the fact that it is fully described by its mean and standard deviation. In the given example, the normal distribution allows us to understand the typical wait times for coffee and how they vary. The practical benefit is that it helps in making informed decisions, such as estimating how long to wait on average and preparing for days when the wait might be unusually long or short. By calculating time ranges based on normal distribution, you can accurately plan your daily routine and schedule, helping you start your day off right. 

2. To calculate the Z-score for a wait time of 10 minutes, we use the formula:

   Z = (X - μ) / σ

   where:
   - X is the value we are interested in (10 minutes),
   - μ is the mean (8 minutes),
   - σ is the standard deviation (2 minutes).

   Plugging in the values:

   Z = (10 - 8) / 2 = 1

   Next, we need to find the probability of a wait time exceeding 10 minutes. This can be found using the Z-table or a standard normal distribution calculator. A Z-score of 1 corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.8413. To find the probability of exceeding 10 minutes, we subtract this value from 1:

   P(X > 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 10) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587

   Therefore, the probability of a wait time exceeding 10 minutes on a given day is approximately 15.87%.

Scenario:

Assume that you are on a social work task where you are collecting data on household income from families in a rural, underprivileged community. After collecting the income data, you find that it follows a Normal Distribution with a mean of $3000 and a standard deviation of $500. Using the properties of the Normal Distribution, you can calculate probabilities and percentiles to provide insights that can help in resource allocation for the community.  

This task requires you to use statistical methods to interpret the income distribution and identify patterns that could aid in addressing the needs of the families in the area. Your task is to identify the proportion of families whose income falls below a specific threshold and to determine the percentile rank of families with higher incomes. 

Questions: 

Based on the income data, find the probability that a randomly selected family has an income below $2500 using the Z-score. 
If a family has an income of $3500, calculate the Z-score and find its percentile rank within the rural household income distribution. 

Answer:

1. To find the probability that a randomly selected family has an income below $2500, we first calculate the Z-score using the formula:

   Z = (X - μ) / σ

   where:
   - X is the value we are interested in ($2500),
   - μ is the mean ($3000),
   - σ is the standard deviation ($500).

   Plugging in the values:

   Z = (2500 - 3000) / 500 = -1

   Next, we look up the Z-score of -1 in the Z-table or use a standard normal distribution calculator. A Z-score of -1 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.1587. 
   Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected family has an income below $2500 is about 15.87%.

2. If a family has an income of $3500, we can calculate the Z-score using the same formula:

   Z = (X - μ) / σ

   where:
   - X is the value we are interested in ($3500),
   - μ is the mean ($3000),
   - σ is the standard deviation ($500).

   Plugging in the values:

   Z = (3500 - 3000) / 500 = 1

   Next, we look up the Z-score of 1 in the Z-table or use a standard normal distribution calculator. A Z-score of 1 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.8413.
   Therefore, the percentile rank of a family with an income of $3500 is about 84.13%.
