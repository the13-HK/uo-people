- What tasks did the assignments involve? 
  - In our English classes so far,ENH1102, we have learned about the techniques necessary for formal English writing.
  Rather than learning about specific English grammar in detail, I learned how to write sentences efficiently regardless of the language.
  The content included learning how to think and organize things at the same time as learning how to write sentences.

- How did you complete the tasks? 
  - Personally, I aimed to solidify my knowledge by not only reading the passages in the weekly reading assignments, but also by thinking back on events that were happening around me on a daily basis and what had happened in the past, and connecting them with what I had learned.
- What strengths and weaknesses were revealed (with regards to writing in English) from these activities? 
  - The knowledge I have acquired through my studies so far is not limited to English, but I have been able to acquire skills that can be used in all languages. I believe that this is an advantage of this study, and that it is becoming one of my strengths.
  On the other hand, its weakness is that it is weak in English-specific grammar and vocabulary. I personally study English every day since it is not my native language, but I feel that I am particularly weak in vocabulary.
  Although I am able to learn vocabulary through this class, I am not able to learn it systematically and efficiently.
- How do you propose to address the areas of improvement in the coming weeks? 
  - I don't think these are things I'm looking for in UoPeople English classes, but rather things I should supplement with my own additional studies. Therefore, it is necessary to further advance the study of English vocabulary and grammar in one's own studies. Fortunately, there are now excellent English learning applications such as Duoligo, so I would like to make full use of them and devote more time to studying English.
