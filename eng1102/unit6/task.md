### Persuasive writing
- A persuasive message is the central message that intrigues, informs, convinces, or calls to action. Every message has elements of ethos, or credibility; pathos, or passion and enthusiasm; and logos, or logic and reason. If your persuasive message focuses exclusively on reason with cold, hard facts and nothing but the facts, you may or may not appeal to your audience. 

- Strategies for persaisive message 
    1. Start with your greatest benefit. 
    2. Take baby steps.
    3. Know your audience.
    4. Lead with emotion, and follow with reason.
- Some key transitional words you should use with this method of organization are: most importantly, almost as importantly, just as importantly, and finally.
- When you talk about something you want to be enphasized, you should use the strong words like "crucial", "essential", "vital". However, if your message is so narrow or 
tunnel visioned, audience may not be interested in your message. So, you should use the evidence or fact-based point of view to make your message more persuasive.

### Discussion Forum
- Share an example of persuasive writing that you have come across recently, such as an article, or advertisement. Analyze how the writer effectively utilizes the elements of persuasive writing to capture your attention and convince you of their viewpoint.

- I chose the examples "Why Napping Should Be Encouraged in Schools?", This article argues that it is right for students to take naps by using the objective facts.
  The great thing about this article is what sets it apart is that it presents objectice facts in a persuasive manner to refute events that are not good for students.
  Besides although everyone wants to refute it, the reasons are usually subjective, and by the time we become adults we have given up on the idea that it was wrong.
  Therefore, this article is interesting because the title is intriguing since it is something that everyone has felt, but it is also an interesting rebuttal based on general evidence, and it makes everyone who reads it realize that their previous thoughts were correct.
  I thought this was exactly the correct use of persuasive writing, and a good example of how this technique can be used to prove the correctness of an event.
  Furthermore, the objective counterarguments used here are merely logically justified, and are not logically flawed. This is a good example of how to use persuasive writing to prove the correctness of an event.

### Assignment Activity
Part 1: Persuasive Paragraph
The word count for this section should be between 500 and 600 words.
    1. Choose a topic you feel strongly about, such as an environmental issue or current event.
        - I'm going to discuss the topic of refuting the public perception that Trump is siding with Russia on the Ukraine issue.
          However, this is a very sensitive topic with many different opinions, so please take it as just one opinion.
          Various changes have been taking place since the second Trump administration began, but one topic that has recently attracted the world's attention is the change in America's attitude toward the Ukraine issue.
          Until now, the Biden administration has provided various forms of support to Ukraine. However, since the Trump administration came to power, it has shown signs of stopping support, such as temporarily suspending aid to Ukraine. In response to this, the media has been reporting in a way that suggests the United States is siding with Russia.

    2. Research your chosen topic thoroughly to gather relevant information, facts, and evidence.
        - I watched the recording of the meeting between the US and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on February 28th.
          It is true that Trump's response to Ukraine is different from previous ones, but what he insisted on was to stop the fighting. Therefore, I learned that he is not siding with Russia, but is negotiating as a third party with the goal of stopping the fighting in Ukraine as soon as possible.
          There were also articles that suggested that the support given to Biden up until now had been kept to a level that would not anger the Russian side.
    3. Use the gathered information to write a persuasive paragraph that clearly states your position and presents compelling arguments to persuade the reader.
        - I believe Trump has the following ideas:
          1. The United States is acting as a neutral party to stop the fighting that is taking place around the world. The reason for this is to protect the American people, and the fighting in Ukraine could trigger World War III if it continues as it is, so the United States wants it to stop as soon as possible.
          2. Despite the fact that the United States has been providing aid for the past few years, the situation has not improved at all. Furthermore, if the United States provides too much aid, it will incur resentment from Russia, so continuing to provide more aid will not improve the situation.
          The US will approach Russia in a different way and impose economic sanctions.

    4. Ensure your paragraph is well-organized, flows smoothly, and utilizes persuasive techniques like emotional appeal, logical reasoning, and credible sources.
        - The United States never wants to side with Russia, but is simply carrying out what it believes to be the best way to protect its own people. And that means not upsetting Russia, and ending a military conflict as soon as possible to prevent it from escalating into World War III.
        Currently in my county, Japan, information is distorted and reported, making it difficult to grasp the true meaning of various pieces of information. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain temporary information as much as possible and use it to organize your own thoughts.


Part 2: Sales Message
    1. Write a persuasive message in about 150 words to sell a product to an intended audience using various strategies. You should craft the message in a way that effectively promotes the product and convinces the audience to purchase it.

        - Do you use a smartphone? Smartphones are one of the products that we will continue to use for a long time to come, and they are an indispensable technology in modern society.
        The iPhone is one of the most popular smartphones in the world and is used by many people around the world. Uniform design is great, but is it the best choice for everyone?
        The cost of Android products varies from company to company, with options starting from around $200. 
        Also, the design is starting to get a little boring. Although it is a well-established design, it has hardly changed at all from the first generation to the current iPhone 16.
        The nothing phone from the UK company nothing has a unique design and offers a different experience to any smartphone out there, and it's a lot cheaper than the iPhone.
        The next time you buy a new smartphone, why not consider an Android smartphone?
