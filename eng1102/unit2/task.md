### Discussion Assignment
1. What are the benefits of using sentence variety in writing? 
    - The benefits of using sentence variety in writing are that it makes the writing more interesting and engaging, helps to maintain the reader's attention, and can emphasize key points or ideas.
    - Sentence variety can also help to create a more natural flow and rhythm in the writing, making it easier to read and understand.
    - Even when I am writing, I feel a lot of anxiety if I only write the same monotonous sentences. I often lose track of what I'm writing, whether it's easy for the other person to understand, or what I'm writing.


2. How do coordination and subordination contribute to the structure and coherence of sentences and paragraphs? 
    - Coordination and subordination are essential for creating clear and coherent sentences and paragraphs. 
    - Coordination allows writers to connect ideas of equal importance, while subordination helps to show the relationship between ideas and establish hierarchy.
    - By using coordination and subordination effectively, writers can create a logical and organized structure that guides the reader through the text.
    - It is possible to flexibly respond to sentence structures that are conscious of the points that need to be coordinated in a sentence and the connections between the two.
    - However, you need to be careful as using too much can make the text more difficult to understand.

3. Why is parallelism important in writing? How does it contribute to clarity and impact? 
   - Parallelism is important in writing because it helps to create a sense of balance and symmetry in the text, making it easier to read and understand.
   - Parallelism can also help to create a sense of unity and coherence in the text, tying together different ideas and elements to create a cohesive whole.
   - In order to use parallelism, it is necessary to be aware of the consistency of words. If they are not consistent, it will be difficult for the reader to understand what is parallel, so it is very important to match tenses and grammatical notation.
   - Parallelism is one of the techniques that I usually use when writing English sentences, but the forms of -ing and -ed, and whether to parallelize just the noun or the document, are very in-depth considerations. I don't think there is a clear correct answer because the easiest parallelism to understand varies depending on the situation.

4. What factors contribute to the readability and flow of written communication in the article you chose? 
   - The overall thing to say is to define keywords in your sentences. By defining the main keywords and subjects and creating consistency, it becomes clear to the reader how to read the text.
   - However, if the expressions and sentence structure are the same, it will become monotonous, so by adding spice sentences, the reader will be stimulated appropriately and can concentrate more on reading the text.


### Assignment Activity
1. Explain any two examples of effective writing principles that you have encountered in the workplace or university.
  - A technique used in various situations by working adults is to state the conclusion first.
    - For reader, it is easier to understand t he content of the text if the conclusion is stated first.
    - Structure of that technique is to state the conclusion first, then explain the reason, and finally explain the details and  provide evidence with references.
  - Second one is specify the subject and purpose.
    - Especially in my native Japanese, there is a culture called wabi-sabi, which values ​​the beauty of conveying what you want to say through nuance rather than saying it directly. Therefore, it is important to check whether subjects and objects are clearly used in business communications.
    - Especially in my native Japanese, there is a culture called wabi-sabi, which values ​​the beauty of conveying what you want to say through nuance rather than saying it directly. Therefore, it is important to check whether subjects and objects are clearly used in business communications.

2. Analyze the importance of effective writing principles in the workplace, using the examples mentioned above. 
   - For examples, this text is intended for email within a certain project.
   - ``` 
      Now, regarding the project proposal that I sent you the other day, I would like to conclude by saying that our company agrees with the proposal and has decided to implement the project.

      We have determined that the proposed content is highly compatible with our current strategy and has significant benefits from a long-term perspective. Regarding the specific implementation plan, the person in charge will contact you with details later.
    ```
    - In this text, the conclusion is stated first, and the reason and details are explained later. This is a technique that is often used in business communication because it is easy to understand the content of the text.
  
3. What are three challenges that people face when trying to write effectively in a professional setting? How can these challenges be overcome? Give clear and detailed examples of how these challenges can be overcome.
   - The first challenge is that the writer's intention is not clear. This is a challenge that can be overcome by clearly stating the purpose of the text and the subject of the text. In business, there are texts for various purposes, and the content required varies greatly depending on the time, situation, and audience. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to accurately explain the requirements within a limited time, so you can overcome this by clearly communicating the main points at the beginning.
   - The second, in most cases in business, the background to the end result is complex and intertwined, and there are countless terms used within the industry. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to communicate smoothly with the other party in writing without being rude. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome this problem by composing sentences with relatively simple words and structures that are not assigned to the teacher, and by making sure that the sentences are easy for anyone to understand.
   - Last, Does this mean that for the two previous assignments, we are going to show them something that anyone would think could be written? Does this mean that there is no need for elements that will earn the other person to respect you?
   The answer is no. Even with these constraints, it is possible to show off the beauty of the writing, and that is what you should do.
   By unifying the front and back relationships, such as the parallelism of sentences and the agreement of tenses, you will be able to instill in others the image of sophisticated writing.

4. Identify three challenges that you face when providing feedback to your peers. 
   - First, One is that there is no clear correct answer. The correct answer may change depending on the person's personality and situation, so it may be difficult to qualify the feedback.
   - Next, different countries have different cultures and communication methods, so it is necessary to give advice that is appropriate for each culture. For example, in Japan, e-mails often include fixed phrases such as spells at the beginning and end. If you don't do that, you may be perceived as disrespectful.
   - Finally, there are cultural differences based on age. Values ​​and social standards have changed between the generation of bosses and the generation of newcomers, and grammar is no exception. It is necessary to capture such changes and provide feedback.
