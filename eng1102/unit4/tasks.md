- Will Donald Trump make America better?
  - The article is written by a reseacher of Pew Research Center.
  To analyze this article, we obtained a survey from about 5,000 people which a group of people
recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take
surveys regularly. 
When asked whether Trump would make America better, 41% said he would make it better and 42% said he would make it worse.
On the other hand, when asked whether Trump's actions so far have been better than expected, 28% said they were good and 35% said they were bad.
These answers vary greatly depending on the political party giving the instructions.
Republicans are giving answers that support Trump, and Democrats are not giving Trump any direction at all.
From the results of the responses, it seems that the percentage of respondents to the survey who are Democrats and Republicans is probably not half, but whether this is a biased opinion depends on whether or not this is roughly in line with the percentage in the entire United States.
In a survey that divided Trump's support into six points, although he had a favorable opinion of strong leadership, he ranked lowest in terms of whether he is ethically right.
For this reason, while strong charisma and action are highly valued, many Americans feel uneasy about whether they can lead America in the right way.
When asked about how much Trump could accomplish, the majority of people gave positive responses.
These surveys often have nothing to do with the president's actual accomplishments or future work. Even great presidents of the past were sometimes divided in favor or disapproval in surveys when they first took office.

Donald Trump has also made a controversial move regarding Elon Musk's entry into politics.
Republicans are positive about this decision, but Democrats are negative. The percentage of Republicans who agreed with the idea was relatively low compared to other opinions, so it was found that the overall percentage had a negative opinion.

- summary
What we should look at from this result is not the percentage, but rather the relative results, such as what kind of people view Trump positively and what kind of viewpoints are relatively positive.
In my absolute opinion, I don't think this report should be used as a basis because of the sample size, lack of mention of bias, and lack of evidence.
On the other hand, the author, affiliated organization, and survey method were described in detail, making the article highly reliable.
