### Reading assignment
- Though you will come across people who don’t want to believe that these new technologies are here to stay, we, as humans, will never be able to separate ourselves from our own inventions, and trying to do so is perhaps only a step backward in an evolutionary sense. Therefore it is important that we learn to adapt our behavior to include the new inventions. Technology, after all, is an extension of the human mind, and the new technologies are only tools we have created over years of fashioning new ways to do things.

### Discussion Assignment
- As a student with multiple writing assignments and deadlines, how can you utilize technology to write effectively in a timely manner? Discuss specific strategies, tools, or platforms that can be used to write in a focused and organized manner. Draw from your own experiences or suggest hypothetical solutions to showcase your creativity and problem-solving skills. Additionally, refer to research and the reading materials of this course to support your arguments. 
- 課題の中でAIを使用する上で重要なことは、どの程度までAIに任せるか、どの程度まで自分で考えるかを明確にすることです。AIは、自分の考えを補完するためのツールであるため、それを超えない程度の使い方にとどめるべきです。（Arnold, V. (2023, April 28)）AIに任せすぎると盗作につながるのは勿論、自身の考えの整理、構築を行うことが出来なくなってしまいます。しかし、AIを使わないと今後のAI使用を前提とした世の中の流れに適用できなくなってしまうでしょう。
AIの使用は全て盗用につながる、という考えが一定あるように感じますが、私はそうは思いません。盗用の定義は他人が構想し創作した素材やアイデアを引用無しで自分のものとして発表することです。（Shier, M. (2020)）そのため、AIを使用して自分の考えを補完することは盗用には当たらないと思います。AIを使用することで、自分の考えを整理し、構築することが出来るため、AIを使用することは盗用には当たりません。1つ問題点としてはAIが勝手に文章生成した際に他の文章をそのまま転用してしまい、無意識に盗用につながる可能性があるため、やはりAIを使用する際はそれが自分の言葉で表現できているかを精査することが必要です。
- When using AI in a task, it is important to clarify to what extent we should leave it to the AI ​​and to what extent we should think about it ourself. AI is a tool to complement our own thinking, so it should be used only to the extent that it does not go beyond that. (Arnold, V. (2023, April 28)) If we leave too much to AI, it will of course lead to plagiarism, and we will not be able to organize and structure our own ideas. However, without the use of AI, it will not be possible to apply it to future trends in the world that assume the use of AI.
We feel like there is a certain belief that all use of AI leads to plagiarism, but we don't think so. The definition of plagiarism is to take material or ideas conceived and created by someone else and present them as one's own without citing them. (Shier, M. (2020)) Therefore, we don't think using AI to supplement our ideas is plagiarism. Using AI does not constitute plagiarism because it allows us to organize and build our own ideas. One problem is that when AI generates sentences without permission, it may repurpose other sentences without realizing it, which could lead to plagiarism, so when using AI, it is necessary to carefully check whether the text can be expressed in one's own words.

### Assignment Activity

1. Introducing the three writing tools.
    - Grammarly
      - Grammarly is a English proofreading tool that uses AI technology to detect grammatical and spelling errors in English texts.
       It also provides suggestions for improving sentence structure and word choice. 
       Grammarly can be used to proofread essays, emails, and other types of writing to ensure that they are error-free and easy to read.
       It is one of the most famous writing tools and is a tool that everyone knows, and often used for everyday English communication and for studying English.
       Grammarly is a browser-based application, so you basically have to enter the text you want to check directly into the application. 
       Unlike other tools, Grammarly is a dedicated text correction tool, so the output is the most reliable and effective for your own study. 
       I think it is suitable for formal situations such as business, and as content for your own study.
    - ChatGPT
      - ChatGPT itself is not just a writing tool, but also a general-purpose AI agent tool that responds to various prompts.
       It is a tool developed by OpenAI, and has been at the forefront of the AI industry since its release.
       Basically, you can ask ChatGPT to do anything you want, so you can also proofread text by entering the details of your request and the text you want to correct into ChatGPT.
       ChatGPT is the most versatile tool compared to other tools, and is one of the most commonly used applications among AI tools. 
       Therefore, I think it is suitable for use as a casual initial check when proofreading sentences or pursuing better expressions, so I envision using it for proofreading internal chats and emails, or as part of work tasks.

    - Notion AI
      - NortionAI is an AI function that is part of the memo app Notion. 
      Notion was originally famous as a memo and task management tool, so NotionAI was created to assist those tools.
      NotionAI can search for data entered in Notion, answer questions based on the information in Notion, and has advanced writing capabilities.
      When you give commands to NotionAI on the command line, the AI will automatically write in Notion. 
      This is not just a string of characters, but it can also structure sentences based on Markdown. 
      Since Notion itself is a task and note management tool, I think it is suitable for use as a replacement for your own tasks and notes.

2. Summary
- Writing tools come in a variety of forms, from tools dedicated to proofreading, to patterns that are equipped as one of the functions of general-purpose AI agents, to patterns that are equipped as one of the functions of auxiliary AI tools for tools such as memo apps, and this diversity will likely increase in the future. 
  These are used differently depending on the scene and purpose of use. 
  When seeking greater accuracy, checking with a dedicated proofreading tool is necessary, but as an auxiliary AI for daily tasks, notes, and casual communication with colleagues, it is sufficient to simply use the proofreading function of an AI agent or an auxiliary AI in a memo app.
