## Assignment Activity


- Scenario:

You are a network engineer tasked with designing a comprehensive data communication and network infrastructure for a new manufacturing plant and office complex owned by a startup company. The plant has significant electromagnetic interference due to heavy machinery, while the office environment requires robust support for data-intensive tasks like video conferencing and high-speed internet access for cloud-based applications. Additionally, the company plans to offer high-speed internet services to nearby residential and business customers and needs to upgrade its network infrastructure to support this.

Based on the given scenario, answer the following questions:

1. Compare and analyze line coding schemes like Manchester, Differential Manchester, and Non-return to Zero (NRZ) in terms of their ability to mitigate interference and ensure reliable data transmission at the physical layer. Justify your choice of line coding scheme based on the specific environmental challenges faced by the manufacturing plant. 

2. Compare the characteristics of twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable in terms of bandwidth, transmission distance, susceptibility to interference, and cost. Determine the most suitable transmission media for different parts of the office network, such as connecting workstations, establishing backbone connections, and linking to external service providers. 

3. Compare the characteristics of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) in terms of bandwidth allocation, scalability, and resistance to interference. Determine which multiplexing technique would be most effective in optimizing bandwidth utilization for the company's diverse customer base. 

- Answer:

1. In the context of the manufacturing plant with significant electromagnetic interference, the choice of line coding scheme is crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission. Among the options of Manchester, Differential Manchester, and Non-return to Zero (NRZ), Differential Manchester coding is the most suitable choice. Differential Manchester coding combines the benefits of both Manchester and NRZ coding. It provides a transition at the beginning of each bit period, which helps in clock recovery and synchronization. Additionally, it has a transition in the middle of the bit period for a '0' bit, which helps to mitigate the effects of electromagnetic interference. This is particularly important in an environment with heavy machinery, as the interference can cause signal degradation. In contrast, NRZ coding does not provide any inherent clocking information and is more susceptible to long sequences of '0's or '1's, which can lead to synchronization issues. Manchester coding, while effective in providing clocking information, has a higher bandwidth requirement due to its two transitions per bit, making it less efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization. Therefore, Differential Manchester coding strikes a balance between reliability and efficiency, making it the best choice for the manufacturing plant's challenging environment.  
2. When considering the transmission media for the office network, it is essential to evaluate twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable based on their characteristics. Twisted pair cables, such as Cat5e or Cat6, are cost-effective and suitable for connecting workstations within the office. They offer sufficient bandwidth for typical office applications, including video conferencing and internet access, with a maximum transmission distance of around 100 meters. However, they are more susceptible to electromagnetic interference compared to other media. Coaxial cables provide better shielding against interference and can support higher bandwidths over longer distances (up to 500 meters). They are suitable for backbone connections within the office, where higher data rates and reduced interference are required. Fiber-optic cables, on the other hand, offer the highest bandwidth and the longest transmission distances (up to several kilometers) with minimal susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. They are ideal for linking to external service providers and for any high-speed backbone connections that require future scalability. Although fiber-optic cables are more expensive than twisted pair and coaxial cables, their performance benefits justify the cost in critical parts of the network. Therefore, a combination of twisted pair for workstation connections, coaxial for backbone connections, and fiber-optic for external links would provide an optimal balance of cost and performance for the office network.  
3. In terms of multiplexing techniques, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) each have their strengths and weaknesses. TDM allocates time slots to different data streams, allowing multiple signals to share the same transmission medium without interference. This technique is highly scalable, as additional channels can be added by simply increasing the number of time slots. TDM is also less susceptible to interference since each channel is separated in time. However, it requires precise synchronization between the transmitter and receiver, which can be a challenge in some environments. FDM, on the other hand, divides the available bandwidth into separate frequency bands for each data stream. This allows for simultaneous transmission of multiple signals, making it suitable for applications that require continuous data flow. However, FDM is more susceptible to interference, as overlapping frequency bands can lead to crosstalk and signal degradation. Additionally, FDM is less scalable than TDM, as adding more channels requires additional frequency bands, which may not always be available. Given the company's need to optimize bandwidth utilization for a diverse customer base, TDM would be the most effective multiplexing technique. Its scalability and resistance to interference make it well-suited for handling varying data demands from residential and business customers while ensuring reliable service quality. 

In conclusion, the network design for the manufacturing plant and office complex should incorporate Differential Manchester coding to mitigate electromagnetic interference, a combination of twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cables to balance cost and performance, and Time Division Multiplexing to optimize bandwidth utilization for the company's diverse customer base. This comprehensive approach addresses the specific challenges of each environment while ensuring reliable and efficient data communication across the entire network infrastructure.
