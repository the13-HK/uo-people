Questions:
Imagine, you are a database administrator working for a small e-commerce company that sells a variety of products online. The company wants to enhance its database system to better manage its inventory, orders, and customers.

1. Considering the four entities namely Product, Customer, Order, and Inventory. Define the relationships between these entities and identify key attributes for each entity.

2. Translate the above four identified entities and attributes into tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys.

3. Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that visually represents the structure of the e-commerce company's database system. Include all entities, relationships, attributes, and keys identified in parts (a) and (b). Clearly indicate cardinality and participation constraints. Ensure the ER diagram is properly labelled and easy to understand.

4. Explain two differences between conceptual and physical design in this scenario, highlighting their respective roles in database development and implementation.

Answers:
1. **Entity Relationships and Key Attributes**:
   - **Product**: Represents items available for sale.
     - Key Attributes: ProductID (Primary Key), Name, company, price.
   - **Customer**: Represents individuals who purchase products.
     - Key Attributes: CustomerID (Primary Key), name, age, address, email.
   - **Order**: Represents transactions made by customers.
     - Key Attributes: OrderID (Primary Key), OrderDate, CustomerID (Foreign Key), orderAmount, productID (Foreign Key).
   - **Stock**: Represents stock levels of products.
     - Key Attributes: ProductID (Primary Key), Amount.
     - Relationships:
       - A Product can have a Stock entry (one-to-one relationship).
       - A Customer can place multiple Orders (one-to-many relationship).
       - An Order can contain multiple Products (many-to-many relationship).
 - **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**:
   - The ER diagram would include the entities Product, Customer, Order, and Stock, with their attributes and relationships. 
   - The relationships would be represented as lines connecting the entities, with cardinality (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) indicated by symbols (like crow's feet).
   - Primary keys would be underlined in each entity, and foreign keys would be indicated in the Order table.
   - The diagram should clearly show how each entity relates to the others, such as a Customer placing Orders and Products being part of those Orders.
   - **Differences between Conceptual and Physical Design**:
   - **Conceptual Design**: Focuses on the high-level structure of the database, defining entities, relationships, and attributes without considering how they will be implemented. It is more about understanding the business requirements and how data will be organized logically.
   - **Physical Design**: Involves the actual implementation of the database, including how data will be stored, indexed, and accessed. It considers performance, storage requirements, and specific database management system (DBMS) features. Physical design translates the conceptual model into a format that can be executed by a DBMS.
   - In this scenario, the conceptual design would involve defining the entities and their relationships, while the physical design would focus on creating the actual tables, specifying data types, and optimizing for performance.
   - **Conclusion**:
   - The e-commerce company's database system can be effectively designed by identifying key entities, their relationships, and attributes. By translating these into tables and creating an ER diagram, the structure of the database can be visualized. Understanding the differences between conceptual and physical design is crucial for successful database development and implementation, ensuring that the system meets business needs while being efficient and scalable.
