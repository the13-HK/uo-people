Question:
Watch this video that shows how culture affects interpersonal communication in a business setting. After you finish watching it, please evaluate how cultural differences can lead to communication issues and differences and suggest effective solutions to address them.

Answer:
Cultural differences in Japan and the United States can lead to various communication issues in a business setting. One significant difference is the approach to hierarchy and authority. In Japan, there is a strong emphasis on respect for seniority and hierarchy, which can lead to indirect communication styles. Employees may hesitate to express disagreement or provide feedback directly to superiors, fearing it may be seen as disrespectful. In contrast, American culture tends to value directness and openness, where employees are encouraged to share their opinions freely, regardless of their position in the hierarchy. Beside, in Japan, quiteness is valued, and silence can be a sign of respect or contemplation. In the U.S., silence may be interpreted as a lack of interest or agreement, leading to misunderstandings during meetings or negotiations. This difference in communication styles can create challenges when collaborating on projects or making decisions.
To address these communication issues, organizations can implement several strategies. First, cross-cultural training programs can help employees understand and appreciate cultural differences, fostering a more inclusive work environment. Second, encouraging open dialogue and creating safe spaces for employees to express their thoughts can bridge the gap between indirect and direct communication styles. Finally, utilizing diverse teams can bring together different perspectives, promoting collaboration and reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings.
