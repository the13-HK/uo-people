- Answer: Public speaking anxiety is a common challenge that many individuals face, including myself. During my presentation for this week’s assignment activity, I encountered several unexpected challenges that stemmed from my anxiety. One of the most surprising aspects was how quickly my mind would go blank when I was in front of an audience. Despite having practiced extensively, I found myself struggling to recall key points and transitions between topics. This experience highlighted the importance of not only practicing the content but also simulating the actual presentation environment to build confidence.
To mitigate these challenges, I employed several delivery methods. I used a combination of memorization and note cards to guide my presentation. While I found that memorization helped me stay on track, I also appreciated the flexibility that note cards provided, allowing me to glance at them for prompts without feeling overly reliant on them. The delivery method I liked the best was a conversational style, where I aimed to engage with the audience by making eye contact and using natural gestures. This approach helped me feel more connected to the audience and reduced my anxiety by making the presentation feel more like a dialogue rather than a monologue.
If I were an audience member, I would most prefer a speaker to use a conversational delivery method. This style is engaging and makes the content more relatable, as it feels like the speaker is sharing their knowledge in a friendly manner rather than lecturing. Additionally, a conversational approach often includes storytelling elements, which can make the information more memorable and impactful. Overall, I believe that practicing in a way that simulates real presentation conditions and adopting a conversational delivery style can significantly enhance both the speaker's confidence and the audience's experience. To additionally, I think it is very important that we practice thoroughly in order to achieve what we are trying to achieve during the actual performance, and to be able to naturally say the phrases and expressions that we have prepared.
