# UNIT 2: Effective Professional Communication

## Memo
- Effective Professional Communication has four key elements:
  - Receiving
    - Important for receiving process is not only hearing but also understanding the message. If you do not understand the message, you just hear sound or noise. Besides, it is also important to attend to non-verbal signals, such as body language and facial expressions, to fully grasp the message.
  - Understanding
    - This stage should be determined by the context and situation. For example, if you are in a business meeting, you should understand the message in a formal way. On the other hand, if you are with your friends, you can understand the message in an informal way.
    If you feel difficult to understand the message, you can ask questions or paraphrase the message to confirm your understanding.
  - Evaluating
    - This stage is to judge the message. You should evaluate the message based on its content, source, and context. For example, if the message is from a reliable source, you can trust it. On the other hand, if the message is from an unreliable source, you should be cautious. In this stage, you need to be obvious of your biases and prejudices that may affect your evaluation.
  - Responding
    - This stage is to give feedback to the sender. You can respond verbally or non-verbally. For example, you can nod your head to show that you understand the message. On the other hand, you can say "I agree" or "I disagree" to express your opinion. In this stage, you should be respectful and considerate of the sender's feelings.

- Reasons why effective listening is not easy:
  - Low Concertration
  - Lack of Prioritization
  - Poor judgement

- Important factors for effective professional communication:
  - Emotional Intelligence
    - Emotional intelligence has five components:
      - Knowing my emotions
      - Managing my emotions
      - Motivating myself
      - Recognizing emotions in others
      - Handling relationships

## Discussion Forum
- Question:
1. Reflect on your own communication style—do you tend to be direct, empathetic, analytical, or convincing? In your initial post, share your self-evaluation and why you do it that way. Provide an example of a situation where your communication style had a positive effect. How did this help you communicate better with them? 

2. Compare and contrast two different communication styles you have seen in real life. Explain how these styles influenced relationships and outcomes in a team. 

3. Discuss how understanding was achieved in collaborative decision-making and conflict-resolution situations. What did you learn from these situations, and how will you adapt your communication style in the future? 

- Answer:
1. I tend to have an direct communication style. I believe that being direct helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that the message is clear and concise. For example, in a previous job, I was part of a team working on a critical project with tight deadlines. Our team leader emphasized the importance of clear and open communication, encouraging us to share updates and challenges regularly. This approach fostered a collaborative environment where we could address issues promptly, leading to the successful completion of the project ahead of schedule. By being direct, I was able to convey my ideas and concerns effectively, which helped to build trust and respect among team members.

2. I have seen two different communication styles in real life: empathetic and analytical. An empathetic communication style focuses on understanding and addressing the emotions and feelings of others. For example, a manager who uses an empathetic style may take the time to listen to their team members' concerns and provide support during difficult times. This approach can help to build strong relationships and foster a positive team atmosphere. On the other hand, an analytical communication style focuses on facts, data, and logical reasoning. For example, a project manager who uses an analytical style may present data-driven reports and make decisions based on evidence. This approach can help to ensure that decisions are well-informed and objective. In a team setting, the empathetic style can help to build trust and collaboration, while the analytical style can help to ensure that decisions are based on sound reasoning. Both styles have their strengths and weaknesses, and it is important to adapt one's communication style based on the situation and audience.

3. In collaborative decision-making and conflict-resolution situations, understanding was achieved through active listening and open communication. For example, in a team meeting where there was a disagreement about the direction of a project, the team members took the time to listen to each other's perspectives and concerns. By actively listening and asking clarifying questions, they were able to understand the underlying issues and find common ground. This approach helped to de-escalate the conflict and led to a collaborative decision that everyone could support. From this experience, I learned the importance of being open-minded and willing to consider different viewpoints. In the future, I will adapt my communication style by incorporating more empathy and active listening, especially in situations where there may be disagreements or conflicts. This will help me to build stronger relationships and foster a more collaborative environment.

## Assignment Activity
- Scenario:

This assignment assesses your skills/knowledge to develop and use active listening skills to engage attentively and interpret contexts. 

Active listening is an integral part of professional communication, as it helps to understand underlying meanings, feelings, and intentions.  


Please complete the two questions in this assignment. 


1. Describe a situation in which you were communicating with someone by highlighting the communication style you employed before learning about active listening strategies. What are the challenges you faced in these interactions? 
 
2. After gaining knowledge of active listening theory, how did your approach evolve? Please provide an example of the conversation. 

- Answer:
1. Before learning about active listening strategies, I often employed a direct communication style. Direct communication style has some features. First, it focuses on conveying the message clearly and efficiently. For example, I tend to get straight to the point without much small talk or pleasantries. Second, it tends to be straightforward and to the point, often without much elaboration or context. For instance, I might say something like "We need to finish this project by Friday" instead of "I think it would be great if we could try to wrap up this project by the end of the week." This approach can be effective in certain situations, such as in a business meeting or when giving instructions. However, it can also lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings if the other person is not used to this style of communication. The challenges I faced in these interactions included misinterpretations, lack of engagement, and potential conflicts. Third, it may prioritize the speaker's perspective over the listener's feelings or viewpoints. In my experience, I would focus on getting my point across quickly, sometimes at the expense of fully understanding the other person's perspective. For example, during a team meeting at work, I was discussing a project deadline with a colleague who was concerned about the feasibility of meeting it. I quickly dismissed their concerns and insisted that we could manage the deadline without any issues. The challenge I faced in this interaction was that my colleague felt unheard and undervalued, which led to tension and a lack of collaboration in the team. My direct approach did not allow for an open exchange of ideas, and I missed the opportunity to address their concerns effectively.

2. After gaining knowledge of active listening theory, my approach to communication evolved significantly. I began to focus more on understanding the other person's perspective and emotions rather than just conveying my own message. For instance, in a subsequent conversation with the same colleague about a different project, I made a conscious effort to practice active listening. I started by giving them my full attention, maintaining eye contact, and using non-verbal cues like nodding to show that I was engaged. When they expressed concerns about the project's scope, I paraphrased their points to ensure I understood them correctly and asked open-ended questions to encourage them to elaborate further. For example, I said, "It sounds like you're worried about the resources we have for this project. Can you tell me more about what specific challenges you foresee?" This approach helped to create a more collaborative atmosphere, and my colleague felt more comfortable sharing their thoughts. As a result, we were able to address their concerns together and come up with a more realistic project plan. This experience reinforced the importance of active listening in fostering effective communication and building stronger relationships.
