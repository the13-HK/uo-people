Answer:
1. The most critical factors to consider when selecting a computer architecture for a specific application is the intended use case. If the application requires high computational power like scientific simulations or data analysis and games, then a high-performance architecture with multiple core and high clock speeds would be essential. In case, the indicator to look out for is CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) which indicates how many cycles the CPU takes to execute an instruction. The another indicator which should be considered is Clock Speed, which is the speed at which a CPU can execute instructions. A higher clock speed generally means better performance, but it also leads to increased power consumption and heat generation.
If you want to focus on energy efficiency, then architectures that optimize power consumption while maintaining performance, such as ARM-based designs, would be more suitable. For applications requiring compatibility with existing software ecosystems, the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) compatibility becomes crucial. This indicator which we should consider is TDP (Thermal Design Power), which indicates the maximum amount of heat generated by a CPU that the cooling system is designed to dissipate under normal operating conditions. Besides, the amount of cache memory implemented in the CPU can significantly affect performance, especially for applications that require frequent data access.

2. I believe that computer architecture is growing in two directions. First, there is an improvement in the calculation processing inside the CPU. This includes advancements in parallel processing, where multiple cores can handle different tasks simultaneously, leading to better performance for multi-threaded applications. Additionally, the integration of specialized processing units, such as GPUs and TPUs, is becoming more common to accelerate specific workloads like machine learning and graphics rendering. In terms of cache capacity and cache access speed, we can expect to achieve improved speed efficiency at lower costs.
Another point is improving the performance of the software. Currently, high-level languages in particular are translated into machine code on the middleware side. By improving the speed of this translation into machine code and the processing power, we will be able to achieve higher performance in the execution of applications. 

3. A real-world example of choosing the right CPU architecture leading to significant performance gains is the transition from Intel x86 architecture to ARM-based processors in mobile devices. Apple’s shift to its own ARM-based M1 chip in 2020 resulted in substantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency for its Mac lineup. The M1 chip, designed specifically for Apple's ecosystem, provided better integration with software, leading to faster application performance and longer battery life compared to previous Intel-based Macs. Before this transition, many users experienced performance bottlenecks or higher power consumption with Intel processors, especially in tasks like video editing and software development. The M1 chip's architecture allowed for a more efficient use of resources, demonstrating how selecting the right CPU architecture can lead to significant performance gains and cost savings in terms of energy consumption.

4. Will X64 become the mainstream CPU architecture in the future, or will mobile chips like the M1 chip become the mainstream?

2. Summarize the significance of interrupt handling in the Z80 microprocessor, and how does it ensure smooth operation? 

Answer:
1. **Execution of Instructions and Interrupt Handling in the Z80 Microprocessor**
First of all, the Z80 microprocessor is one of the most popular microprocessors used in early computing systems. In 1980s, it was widely used in personal computers and embedded systems. The Z80 executes instructions through a fetch-decode-execute cycle, which is a fundamental process in microprocessor operation. Nowdays, the Z80 is still used in various scenes, such as embedded systems, retro computing, and educational purposes. The Z80's instruction is based on a instruction set of intel 8080, which developed by Intel in the end of 1973. This instruction includes 
transfer and exchange orders, arithmetic and logic operations, control flow instructions, and input/output operations etc. The Z80 also has a set of registers that store data temporarily during instruction execution. Besides, the Z80 microprocessor executes instructions through a fetch-decode-execute cycle. This cycle begins with fetching the instruction from memory, decoding it to understand what operation is required, and then executing that operation. The Z80 has a 16-bit address bus, allowing it to access up to 64KB of memory. 
When an instruction is fetched, the Z80 reads the opcode from memory, which tells it what operation to perform. For example, if the opcode corresponds to an addition operation, the Z80 will fetch the necessary operands from registers or memory locations and perform the addition.

In terms of interrupt handling, the Z80 has three main types of interrupts; 0, 1, and 2. In interrupt mode 0 the Z80 gets an instruction from the data bus given by the peripheral and executes it. This instruction is normally RST0 -> RST7 which resets the Z80 to a specific location given by that instruction. In interrupt mode 1 the Z80 jumps to address 0038h where it runs a routine that the programmer implements. In interrupt mode 2 the Z80 gets a byte from the data bus and jumps to the 16-bit address formed by combining the ‘I’ (interrupt vector) register and the supplied byte from the peripheral.(Cook, M., 2015).
When an interrupt occurs, the Z80 stops executing the current instruction and saves its state (registers and program counter) onto the stack. It then jumps to a predefined memory location where the interrupt service routine (ISR) is located. The ISR is a special piece of code designed to handle the specific interrupt. After executing the ISR, the Z80 restores its previous state from the stack and resumes normal operation.

2. **Significance of Interrupt Handling in the Z80 Microprocessor**
 Interrupt handling is crucial in the Z80 microprocessor as it allows the processor to respond to external events or conditions that require immediate attention, such as input from peripherals or timers. By managing interrupts effectively, the Z80 can ensure that high-priority tasks are addressed promptly without significantly disrupting the flow of the main program.
The Z80 supports multiple interrupt modes, including maskable and non-maskable interrupts, which provide flexibility in how interrupts are handled. Maskable interrupts can be enabled or disabled, allowing the processor to ignore certain interrupts during critical operations. Non-maskable interrupts, on the other hand, cannot be ignored and are used for urgent tasks that must be addressed immediately.
This interrupt handling mechanism ensures smooth operation by allowing the Z80 to multitask effectively, responding to events as they occur while maintaining the integrity of the main program. It prevents the processor from being locked in a single task, enabling it to handle real-time data and user inputs efficiently. Overall, interrupt handling is a fundamental aspect of the Z80 microprocessor that enhances its responsiveness and functionality in various applications.
